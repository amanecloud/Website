# Wordpress on Google Cloud

We at [CloudControl](https://www.ecloudcontrol.com) decided to give our webiste a facelift. The site is using Wordpress with Avada theme. This repo is used for our GitOps based deployment using our flagship [GitOps platform AppZ](https://www.ecloudcontrol.com/achieving-infrastructure-agility-with-cloud-controls-appz/). 

Learn more about our GitOps platform and watch the video of the deployment at [Wordpress on Google Cloud](https://www.ecloudcontrol.com/wordpress-on-google-cloud/)
